      <h1>GainsMaxx Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="meta">Last updated: February 13, 2026</p>

      <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the GainsMaxx mobile
        application and related services (the "Service"). The Service is
        provided by GainsMaxx ("we", "us", "our").
      </p>

      <h2>2. Acceptance of these Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By creating an account, accessing, or using the Service, you agree to
        these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Eligibility and accounts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Age</strong>: You must be old enough to enter into a binding
          contract in your jurisdiction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Account security</strong>: You are responsible for maintaining
          the confidentiality of your login credentials and for activity under
          your account.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accurate information</strong>: You agree to provide accurate
          information and keep it up to date.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. What the Service does</h2>
      <p>
        GainsMaxx helps you track your meals and nutrition by logging what you
        eat, whether by typing, speaking, or photographing your food. The app
        uses AI to estimate nutritional information (macros, calories) and can
        integrate with Apple Health to display your daily calorie balance. Some
        features require you to grant device permissions (e.g., microphone,
        camera, health data) and to provide explicit consent for AI processing
        of your meal data.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Your content</h2>
      <p>
        You retain rights to the content you provide to the Service (including
        meal descriptions, photos of food, voice recordings, and related inputs)
        ("User Content"). You grant us a limited license to host, process,
        transmit, and display User Content solely to provide and improve the
        Service and to operate it securely.
      </p>

      <h2>6. AI processing and consent</h2>
      <p>
        Certain features require sending your meal descriptions, photos, and
        audio to our backend for AI processing (transcription and nutritional
        analysis). If you do not provide consent for AI processing, you may be
        unable to use features that depend on it (e.g., voice input, photo-based
        logging, automatic macro extraction). You can revoke consent in-app;
        revoking consent may limit or disable those features.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Health data</h2>
      <p>
        If you choose to connect Apple Health (HealthKit), we will read certain
        health data (such as active energy burned) to display your calorie
        balance. This integration is optional and subject to your device
        permissions. We do not sell or share your health data with third parties
        for marketing purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Accuracy of nutritional information</h2>
      <p>
        The nutritional estimates (calories, macros) provided by the Service are
        generated by AI and are approximate. They are not a substitute for
        professional nutrition or medical advice. You are responsible for
        reviewing the estimates and for any dietary decisions you make.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Acceptable use</h2>
      <p>You agree not to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the Service for unlawful, harmful, or abusive purposes.</li>
        <li>
          Attempt to reverse engineer, disrupt, or compromise the Service.
        </li>
        <li>
          Upload malware or attempt to gain unauthorized access to accounts,
          systems, or data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the Service to infringe intellectual property or privacy rights of
          others.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>10. Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> explains how we collect, use, and
        share information. It is incorporated into these Terms by reference.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Changes, availability, and termination</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Changes</strong>: We may modify the Service or these Terms
          from time to time. If changes are material, we will provide notice
          where required by law.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Availability</strong>: The Service may be interrupted or
          unavailable at times; we do not guarantee uninterrupted operation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Termination</strong>: You may stop using the Service at any
          time and can delete your account in-app. We may suspend or terminate
          access if you violate these Terms or if necessary to protect the
          Service, users, or the public.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>12. Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is provided "as is" and "as available." To the maximum
        extent permitted by law, we disclaim warranties of merchantability,
        fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Nutritional
        estimates and other outputs may be inaccurate; you are responsible for
        reviewing and verifying them. The Service is not a substitute for
        professional medical or nutritional advice.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for
        indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or
        for loss of profits, revenue, data, or goodwill. Our total liability for
        any claim relating to the Service will not exceed the amount you paid us
        for the Service in the 12 months before the event giving rise to the
        claim (or, if you paid nothing, a nominal amount).
      </p>

      <h2>14. Governing law</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of your primary place of residence
        to the extent required by applicable consumer protection laws;
        otherwise, they are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where
        GainsMaxx is established. Courts of competent jurisdiction will have
        exclusive venue, subject to applicable law.
