    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 13, 2026</p>

    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>GainsMaxx</strong> ("we," "our," or "us"). We are
      committed to protecting your personal information and your right to
      privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we
      use it, and your rights regarding your data when you use the GainsMaxx
      mobile application.
    </p>

    <p>
      By using GainsMaxx, you agree to the collection and use of information in
      accordance with this policy.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1. Meal and Nutrition Data</h3>
    <p>
      The core functionality of GainsMaxx involves tracking your meals and
      nutrition.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Text Descriptions:</strong> When you type or speak meal
        descriptions (e.g., "chicken breast with rice"), we store this text and
        send it to our AI service to extract nutritional information (macros,
        calories).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Photos:</strong> You may capture photos of your meals. These
        images are temporarily stored on your device and transmitted securely to
        our AI processor (OpenAI) for analysis to identify food items and
        estimate nutritional content.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Audio Recordings:</strong> When you use voice input to log meals,
        we access your device's microphone. Audio is transmitted securely to our
        AI processor for transcription. The resulting text is then used for meal
        analysis as described above.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Meal History & Results:</strong> We store your meal logs,
        extracted nutritional data (macros, calories), calorie balance goals, and
        AI-generated meal memories to personalize future suggestions and improve
        accuracy. We do not use this data for commercial purposes, advertising,
        or marketing, or share it with third parties for such purposes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2. Device Permissions</h3>
    <p>
      To provide core features, we request access to specific data:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Camera:</strong> To capture photos of your meals for
        AI-powered food recognition.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Microphone:</strong> To record voice input for hands-free meal
        logging.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Apple Health (HealthKit):</strong> On iOS, we may access your
        health data (such as active energy burned) to display your daily
        calorie balance and integrate with your fitness goals. This data is read
        in accordance with Apple's HealthKit guidelines and your explicit
        consent.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Notifications:</strong> To provide reminders and updates
        about your nutrition goals.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3. Account Information</h3>
    <p>When you create an account, we collect:</p>

        management.

    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Third-Party AI Services</h2>
    <p><strong>Important Notice Regarding AI Processing:</strong></p>
    <p>
      GainsMaxx uses <strong>OpenAI</strong> as a third-party service provider
      to process your meal descriptions, photos, and audio.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Transcription:</strong> Your audio recordings are sent to OpenAI
        via their API to generate text transcriptions for meal logging.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Meal Analysis:</strong> Your text descriptions and meal photos
        are sent to OpenAI to extract food items, portion sizes, and nutritional
        information (macros, calories).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Data Privacy with OpenAI:</strong> We use OpenAI's API
        services. According to OpenAI's API data usage policies, data sent via
        the API is <strong>not</strong> used to train their models.
      </li>
    </ul>
